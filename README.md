# CoolCord
## A [Rosiecord](https://github.com/acquitelol/rosiecord) fork
Modified for my personal use

## What changed?
* I stay on older versions to avoid breaking changes.
* Included OpenDiscordSafariExtension as a workaround for sideloaded instances of CoolCord.
* Bundled OLEDCord tweak for default dark mode.
* Bundled K2genmity for support with K2gelocker and HighlightCode.
* Always hide blocked messages.
* Use normal Enmity deb instead of development deb to reduce load times.
